# Fish-store-JavaScrip

### The purpose of this project 
 This was the final capstone project for Level 1 one in the Hyperion Dev 
 bootcamp. In this project you had to build a functional cart for a web store.
 In this Project I used Javascript and Jquery to give the site some functionality.

 You also get an item page generated for you. On this page you can display extra info on your product.

#### The Cart 
 If you add an item to your cart will calculate the total. You can also add discount and vat to your total.

#### Jquery
 This store also makes use of Jquery to introduce some effects. Bootstrap
 is used for making the store mobile friendly.
